This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
It is called JSX
JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.



when you run npm start command index.hmtl file serve
index.html contain the root dom
next control enter index.js
REact dom render the root dom element


JSX
Js xml (JavaScript extension)
 Clean and elegent
 use transpilers
 in jsx we don't need to export React


Componet Types
1- stateful class c (contains render method which return html)
2- stateless functional c (method return html)


 Component  name should be Pascal case
 every component you create must must import from react
 import React,{Component} from 'react'


 IN class c we can manage state but in react new we can manage state with hooks
 class component provide lifecyle hooks

rendering

 function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  root.render(element);
}
same as above 

function tick() {
  return  (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
